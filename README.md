# go-regular-expressions

Hi my name is John Mannion and I'am a thrid year student in GMIT studying software development. As part my data representation and query module. I was given the task of creating an eliza chatbot using the Go language and html.
The project was to create a web application that allows the user to have a conversation with an interactive chatbot named Eliza. The goal of the project is to fool/trick the user into thinking they are speaking directly to another human being.


# Running the code
To run the code in this repository, the files must first be compiled. The Go [compiler](https://golang.org/doc/install) 
must first be installed on your machine. Once that is installed, the code can be compiled and run by following these steps. We assume you are using the command line or alternatively you can use [cmder](https://cmder.en.softonic.com/).
## Cloning the repository using Git.
1. Use the command git clone to clone this repository https://github.com/JohnMannion51/eliza_chatbot.git.
2. Then cd to the folder in the command line i.e.cd eliza_chatbot.
3. Use the command ls to see what files/folders are in the project.
4. Compile the go file in this case "webapp.go" that produces an executable file "webapp.exe".
5. Run the executable file in the command line .
### Note: You may recieve a firewall warning prompting you to allow access to your network public/private cilck on private, which is recommened by windows 
6. Open up a page on your browser and type the following address 
localhost:8080 and press enter.
7. Once the page opens click on talk to eliza.
8. Another page appears and the user then starts a conversation with Eliza.
9. The user types his question in the input box and Eliza responds.
